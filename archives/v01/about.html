			<h3>About me</h3>
			<h4>The place where you can find interesting stuff about me<br><br></h4>
			<p>Nice to meet you, this is my personal website :)</p>
			<p>The mission that I aspire to keep is pretty straight forward, I want to inspire people to share the things that bring a smile to their faces. What I love doing is having fun with others, this can be playing games, making games, other fun projects or just haning out in general. I believe that the value people bring to this world is "meaning". Meaning to a crazy spinning globe without purpose. Cool that you took the time to actually read this!</p>
			<p>There might be something exciting...</p>
